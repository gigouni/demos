# NodeJS + socket.io = An client/server application
## and a tchat !
Another application following one of the tutorials of OpenClassRooms [right here](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/des-applications-ultra-rapides-avec-node-js/tp-le-super-chat).

It's a really simple application using NodeJs and socket.io to build an interactive app which could permits to a client to send request manually and to a server to send (and broadcast) some other messages. Everything working on a RealTime process !

I don't know if I'll continue this application but it's really interesting to understand how socket.io could interact with my internship application.

## The second part of this project : The tchat !
